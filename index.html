<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

  <p>Despite the technology still being in the early stage of adoption, the past few years has proven to show strong growth for augment reality, also called AR. The innovative technology will have an impact on a wide range of business functions. With the ability to completely redefine how consumers and brands interact, there will be substantial and swift changes in marketing and advertising across industries.</p>

  <p>One way to measure AR’s marketing impact is to look at the rapid growth of AR advertising spending across industries in recent years. Retail has seen the biggest portion of AR advertising spend due to the technology’s ability to engagement with consumers and build brand experiences in a whole new way. Retail is followed by the media and entertainment industry, which utilizes smartphones’ AR capabilities to deliver immersive content to consumers. Other industries, like finance and healthcare, still lag behind as the technology, and it’s uses, continue to develop. The future looks bright for this booming and exciting new technology.</p>
